    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>In recent years, <strong> Kazakhstan's</strong> higher education system has undergone significant reform, with a  primary emphasis on transferring the responsibility for validating graduates' qualifications to  independent entities. According to the Dossier on the Draft Law of the Republic of <strong> Kazakhstan</strong> "On  Professional Qualifications" (June 2023), which governs the recognition of qualifications,  <u> Qualification Confirmation Centers</u> have been established independently of universities. 
        Previously, graduates' qualifications were verified by <u> State Examination Boards </u> affiliated with  universities. These boards primarily assessed graduates' proficiency in core disciplines and evaluated  their final projects. The process of qualification confirmation was typically a mere formality, with  qualification confirmation being automatically granted upon passing exams or successfully defending final projects. </p>
    <p>Presently, the objective of qualification confirmation at independent centers is to  evaluate the preparedness of applicants, including bachelor's degree graduates, for professional roles.  These roles are delineated by professional standards (PS) established for occupations in demand  within the labor market. While the infrastructure for qualification confirmation is still being fully  established, a multitude of professional standards (PS) have been created spanning various sectors of  the economy. As an example, there are 25 approved standards uniquely tailored to the IT industry.</p>
