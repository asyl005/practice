    <p>The various components of modern IT are closely intertwined with each other. First, it is difficult to im agine a highly qualified specialist who has no idea about related fields. <br>For example, a highly qualified sys tem administrator who has no idea about the basics of programming and database administration. As well as  a programmer who does not understand the principles of computer operation and does not know anything  about system administration. <br>Especially if he is busy developing real-time systems, and that is what highly  skilled programmers usually do. This list can be continued for long. 
    </p>
    <p>Second, if a narrow specialist also finds some application in a system integrator or a software company,  then an outsourcer or an IT service company in a non-IT industry will most likely be useless. Because any  practical activity, focused on the result, is connected with the aforementioned architecture.  </p>
